# Multi-Agent-Systems
I took an introductory artificial intelligence course and one of the topics that really interested me was "multi-agent systems."

## Boids
Boids illustrate flocking behavior. According to the slides from the course I took, boids are subject to three forces: cohesion, alignment, and separation. I've made a simplified model that only takes account of cohesion and separation.
